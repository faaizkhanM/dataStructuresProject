# Cab Booking System ‚Äì C++ Qt DSA Project

This is my attempt at my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) final project** for the **4th semester** of my BS Computer Science degree.

A real-world cab booking simulator developed in **C++** using the **Qt framework** and **SQLite database**, demonstrating core DSA concepts through custom implementations and GUI integration.

## üöÄ Features

- **User Management**
  - Registration and login (SQLite-backed)
  - Profile editing and secure credential handling

- **Cab Booking System**
  - Real-time cab availability check
  - Distance and rating-based cab sorting
  - Booking confirmation with animated ride display

- **Driver and Ride Management**
  - Ride tracking, earnings, and ratings
  - Post-ride user feedback with average rating calculation

- **Algorithmic Logic**
  - **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm** for fare and path calculation
  - Modular sorting algorithms (Merge, Quick, Selection)
  - BST for sorted user views
  - Hash table with chaining for fast username lookups
  - Heap-based priority queue for cab selection
